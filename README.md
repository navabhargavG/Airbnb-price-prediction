In this project “NYC Airbnb” dataset from Kaggle containing 74111 rows and 29 columns. The dataset has then been cleaned to ensure data quality and exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps to identify the relevant variables or columns. Null values are handled by using feature engineering. To achieve the challenge of optimizing Airbnb pricing strategy, ML models have been employed to evaluate and compare. These include linear regression, random forest regression, ridge and lasso regression, support vector regression (SVR), XGradient Boosting and artificial neural networks (ANN’s).
